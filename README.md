## Development

### Tech stack

Client is made using modern practises. We are using EcmaScript2015 with babel translator for modular JS and Vue with JSX templates
to render content. Styles are made in pure css.

### Project structure

* `static` dir contains static content like images, fonts and css styles
* JavaScript modules are placed in `src` dir, if module contains Vue component it is placed into `src/components`
* `dist` contains built files
